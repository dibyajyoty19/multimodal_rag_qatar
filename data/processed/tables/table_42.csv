optimistic and in line with historical behavior.

1/ Projections made in the October and April WEO vintage.
2/ Calculated as the percentile rank of the country's output gap revisions (defined as the difference between real time/period ahead estimates. 
3/ Data cover annual obervations from 1990 to 2019 for MAC advanced and emerging economies. Percent of sample on vertical axis.
4/ The Laubach (2009) rule is a linear rule assuming bond spreads increase by about 4 bps in response to a 1 ppt increase in the projected debt-to-
GDP ratio.","","","","","6
