"Assessment. Staff assesses the 2023 external position to be moderately stronger than the level implied by 
fundamentals and desirable policies, based on the External Balance Assessment (EBA-Lite) regression model 
that yields a positive CA gap of 2.0 percent of GDP (text table). The REER regression model, which suggests 
a negative CA gap (–4.7 percent of GDP), was deemed less suitable for Qatar given its currency peg. Qatar’s 
significant reliance on hydrocarbons complicates the application of standard external assessment 
methodologies, given the large hydrocarbon price volatility in 2020–22 and more recent export volume 
volatility. Some of the volatility is captured by the adjustments for cyclical contributions and conflicts 
(0.9 percent and -1.1 percent of GDP, respectively). As the current account surplus is projected to moderate 
further in 2024, the CA gap is expected to narrow, aligning the external position more with the level implied 
by fundamentals and desirable policies.

"Real Exchange Rate",""
"Background. The Riyal has been pegged to the U.S. dollar 
Effective Exchange Rates
(2010 average = 100)
at 3.64 since July 2001. Qatar’s nominal effective exchange 
rate (NEER) appreciated by 1 percent, similar to the US’s.

"Capital and Financial Accounts: Flows and Policy Measures",""
"Background. The capital and financial account weakened in 2023. The composition shifted notably. Net 
portfolio outflows rose by nearly 10 percentage points of GDP to 15 percent of GDP, driven by portfolio 
investments abroad (11 percent of GDP). In contrast, net other investment outflows declined by 
16 percentage points to 1 percent of GDP. Overseas investment declined and net reduction in liabilities 
mostly by commercial banks following the introduction of QCB measures, moderated. In 2024Q2, net 
portfolio outflows abated while net incurrence of other investment liabilities resumed.",""
