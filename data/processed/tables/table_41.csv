Commentary: Medium-term risks are assessed as low, consistent with the mechanical ""low"" signal. Gross financing needs under the stress scenario are 
small. Large net financial assets held by the sovereign wealth fund mitigate risks.

2/ The comparison group is emerging markets, commodity exporter, surveillance.
3/ The signal is low risk if the DFI is below 1.13; high risk if the DFI is above 2.08; and otherwise, it is moderate risk.
4/ The signal is low risk if the GFI is below 7.6; high risk if the DFI is above 17.9; and otherwise, it is moderate risk.
5/ The signal is low risk if the GFI is below 0.26; high risk if the DFI is above 0.40; and otherwise, it is moderate risk.",""
