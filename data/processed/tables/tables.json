In 2019, Qatar released its first National AI Strategy, \nfocusing on education, data access, employment, business, research, and ethics. The AI Committee, \nestablished in 2021, coordinates efforts from ministries, universities, and financial institutions. A $2.5 billion \nAI investment package was announced in May 2024. AI-related research has also surged. Overall, Qatar is \nclose to AEs in its AI readiness (text chart).  \nIncreasing AI adoption in Qatar is expected to bring more benefits than risks to the labor market. \nCurrently, about 37 percent of the labor force in Qatar is exposed to AI (18 ppts increase over a decade), \ncomparable to the EM average but lower than the AE average (58 percent). Building on IMF (2023)2 staff \nanalysis suggests that about 75 percent of the high AI exposure jobs in Qatar have high \n“complementarity”—workers in those jobs are more likely to benefit from AI-driven productivity gains than \nbeing replaced.

Private sector employment has grown by around 27 percent over the \nlast decade, but the number of technicians and professionals—two job categories with high AI exposure and \ncomplementarity—has increased by over 90 percent, significantly enhancing the country's potential to \nbenefit from AI adoption. \n“Enabling clusters” identified in NDS3 are likely to harness AI-driven productivity gains. By matching \nthe occupational composition of these clusters (IT & digital, financial services, and education) in Qatar with \nthe AI exposure-complementarity matrix, staff finds that these sectors concentrate in the high AI exposure \nand complementarity quadrant. On the other hand, the “growth clusters” identified in NDS3—\nmanufacturing, logistics, and tourism—tend to have more limited AI exposure.  \nScenario analysis points to potential gains in labor productivity from AI penetration in Qatar. Staff \nanalysis suggests that, under an optimistic scenario where successful reforms to enhance human capital, \ninnovation and private sector growth allow a more rapid increase in the share of jobs exposed to AI and \nfaster AI adoption (than under the baseline), labor productivity growth could be lifted by an average of 1 ppt \nannually (above the baseline) over the medium term. \n \nEconomic Impacts.” \n2 Pizzinelli et al. 2023, \"Labor Market Exposure to AI: Cross-country Differences and Distributional Implications\" |  |  |  |  | ",

In \n2024H1, tourism continued to be strong, but hydrocarbon export volume remained weaker than historical \nlevels, capping the current account surplus. In the medium term, hydrocarbon prices are projected to \nprogressively decline but export volume is set to increase owing to a significant ramp up in LNG production in \nthe pipeline. As domestic demand recovers, imports are expected to strengthen. On balance, the current \naccount gap is expected to continue narrowing. \nPotential Policy Responses: Structural reforms to enhance productivity and competitiveness, as envisaged \nunder NDS3 and the QNV 2030, would help raise private investment and reduce the saving-investment gap. \nFiscal prudence should be preserved, revenue diversification toward non-hydrocarbon sources accelerated, and \nspending reoriented to support the reform agenda.
