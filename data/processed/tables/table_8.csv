1/ PIH benchmark is calculated to ensure constant real per-
capita income. Long-term parameters: Inflation and non-
hydrocarbon real output growth = 2 percent, population 
growth = 0.75 percent, natural gas production volume = 
constant after NF expansion in 2030, nominal hydrocarbon 
price growth = 2 percent, nominal returns on QIA assets and 
discount rate = both 4.75 percent. Standard deviation range 
is based on historical oil price performance to capture the 
sensitivity of the PIH estimates to oil price volatility, thus 
enhancing robustness of the estimates.",""
