1/ Non-hydrocarbon output is regressed on current spending (L0 and L1), capital spending (L1 and L2), global output, 
and oil prices, all in real growth rates, on a 12-year rolling basis ending in the year indicated on the horizontal scale, 
using annual data for Qatar spanning 1983–2023. Coefficients on the first and second lag of capital spending are 
displayed.","",""
